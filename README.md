# Nitro
Nitro allows for users to send and receive large files directly to and from one another.

Use:
```gcc main.cpp
./a.out receive filename_to_create.txt 9999 
./a.out send filename_to_send.txt 127.0.0.1:9999
```
Starter code was taken from https://developerweb.net/viewtopic.php?id=5843 and modified for my use cases.
